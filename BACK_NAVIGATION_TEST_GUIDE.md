# Back Navigation Fix - Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: App showed exit prompts on every screen when pressing back button
**Solution**: Centralized back handler that only shows exit prompts on login screens

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Build and Run the App
```bash
npm run android
# or
npm run ios
```

### 2. Test Hardware Back Button

#### Login Screens (Should Show Exit Dialog):
1. **LoginScreen**: Press back → Should show "Are you sure you want to exit?"
2. **AgentLoginScreen**: Press back → Should show "Are you sure you want to exit?"

#### App Screens (Should Navigate Back Naturally):
1. **Home → Property Detail**: Press back → Should return to Home
2. **Profile → Account Settings**: Press back → Should return to Profile  
3. **City Selection → Area Selection**: Press back → Should return to City Selection
4. **Any Deep Screen**: Press back → Should go to previous screen

### 3. Test UI Back Button

#### All Screens:
- UI back button should behave exactly like hardware back button
- No exit prompts except on login screens
- Smooth navigation back through the app

### 4. Test Navigation Flow

#### Complete Flow Test:
1. Start at Login → Login successfully
2. Navigate: City Selection → Area → Localities → Home → Property Detail
3. Press back multiple times → Should navigate back through each screen
4. Eventually reach City Selection (initial app screen)
5. From City Selection, back should not show exit prompt (goes to previous screen if any)

#### Logout and Re-login Test:
1. Navigate deep into the app
2. Logout (goes to LoginScreen)
3. Press back on LoginScreen → Should show exit dialog ✅

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- Natural back navigation through the app
- Exit dialog only on LoginScreen and AgentLoginScreen
- UI and hardware back buttons behave the same
- No interrupting dialogs during normal navigation
- Smooth user experience

### ❌ Issues to Report:
- Exit dialog appearing on non-login screens
- Back button not working on any screen
- UI back button behaving differently from hardware back
- App crashing when pressing back
- Navigation getting stuck
