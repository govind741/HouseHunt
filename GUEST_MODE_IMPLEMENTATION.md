# Guest Mode Implementation - Login Redirect Fix

## Problem
Users visiting the platform without logging in were getting stuck on the login page. Even after closing and reopening the browser (or re-entering the URL), the system still forced them to the login page instead of redirecting to the intended city page.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a guest mode system that allows users to browse the app without authentication while protecting user-specific features behind login requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Changes
**File: `src/navigation/AppRoutes/index.tsx`**
- Changed `initialRouteName` from conditional `token ? "HomeScreenStack" : "AuthStack"` to always `"HomeScreenStack"`
- This ensures users always land on the main app flow instead of being forced to login

### 2. Auth State Management
**File: `src/store/slice/authSlice.ts`**
- Added `isGuestMode: boolean` to the auth state interface
- Added `setGuestMode` action to manage guest state
- Modified `setToken` to automatically disable guest mode when token is set
- Modified `clearAuthState` to return to guest mode when auth is cleared
- Set `isGuestMode: true` as default in initial state

### 3. Navigation Initialization
**File: `src/navigation/index.tsx`**
- Added guest mode initialization logic
- Set guest mode based on whether user has a stored token
- Import and use the new `setGuestMode` action

### 4. Authentication Guard Hook
**File: `src/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` (New)**
- Created a reusable hook for managing authentication requirements
- `requireAuth()` function redirects to login if user is not authenticated
- `isAuthenticated` boolean for checking auth status
- `isGuestMode` boolean for checking guest status

### 5. Protected Screens
Added authentication guards to screens that require login:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screen/AppScreen/ProfileScreen/index.tsx`
- `src/screen/AppScreen/SavedScreen/index.tsx`
- `src/screen/AppScreen/AddReviewScreen/index.tsx`
- `src/screen/AppScreen/AccountSettings/index.tsx`
- `src/screen/AppScreen/PaymentOptionsScreen/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added imports for `useAuthGuard` and `useFocusEffect`
- Added authentication check using `useFocusEffect` that runs when screen comes into focus
- Users are automatically redirected to login when trying to access these screens without authentication

### 6. Guest Mode Prompt Component
**File: `src/components/GuestModePrompt.tsx` (New)**
- Reusable component for showing login prompts to guest users
- Can be used in screens that have mixed content (some accessible to guests, some requiring login)
- Customizable message and button text
- Automatically navigates to login screen

## How It Works

### For Guest Users:
1. App starts and loads the `CitySelectionScreen` (or last visited screen)
2. Users can browse cities, properties, and other public content
3. When trying to access protected features (Profile, Saved, Reviews, etc.), they are redirected to login
4. After successful login, they return to the main app flow

### For Authenticated Users:
1. App loads with their stored token and user data
2. Guest mode is automatically disabled
3. All features are accessible without additional authentication checks

### Navigation Flow:
```
App Start → HomeScreenStack (CitySelectionScreen) → Browse freely
                ↓
        Try to access protected feature
                ↓
        Not authenticated? → AuthStack (LoginScreen)
                ↓
        Login successful → Return to HomeScreenStack
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can immediately start browsing without being forced to login
2. **Increased Engagement**: Allows users to explore the platform before committing to registration
3. **Seamless Authentication**: Protected features smoothly redirect to login when needed
4. **Persistent State**: User's browsing session is maintained even after login
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing authenticated user flows remain unchanged

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Fresh Install**: Clear app data and launch - should go to CitySelectionScreen
2. **Guest Browsing**: Navigate through cities, properties, and public screens
3. **Protected Access**: Try accessing Profile, Saved, or other protected screens - should redirect to login
4. **Post-Login**: After login, should return to main app with full access
5. **Logout**: Should return to guest mode while maintaining browsing capability

## Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Content**: Some screens could show limited content to guests with prompts to login for full features
2. **Guest Analytics**: Track guest user behavior to optimize conversion
3. **Social Login**: Add quick social login options for easier conversion
4. **Guest Bookmarks**: Allow temporary bookmarking that converts to permanent after login
